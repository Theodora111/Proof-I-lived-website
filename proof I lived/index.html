        <p>I thought of you a lot today. Called my friend on the phone for 30 minutes. 
          Sometimes I wonder how meeting you has changed me.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="box row2">
        <p>The leaves are falling off the trees, bright orange. The weather is much too warm for November. 
            It hasn’t rained in a while.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="box row3">
        <p>I Spilled milk this morning. Planning to see an exhibition on the weekend with a new friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box row4">
        <p>Things are good today. The weeks pass quickly, I wonder if it will snow this year. There are so many things I want to speak about.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="box row5">
        <p>Today, I thought about the first time i met you again. I was so young, so were you. 
            I think I look for you in other people.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="box row6">
        <p>Had the flu over the weekend. Broke a lightbulb and decided to go to bed and replace it in the morning.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="box row7">
        <p>Do you remember that day in summer where I couldn't get rid of you? I was trying to save a dying bee,
             and you were haunting me like a ghost in a sundress.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box row8">
        <p>An uneventful day. The wind is biting cold, I can't see to get my feet to warm up. Soup for dinner.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box row9">
        <p>It was in summer, when so many other things happened. 
            I didn't think I'd see you again after that. Everything smelled like the linden tree on the street and I felt like my skin was glowing. Sometimes i wonder if any of this was important. 
            I wonder how meeting me has changed you.</p>
